# Master-s-thesis-R-codes
These are the R codes for the data cleaning, wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis in my Master's thesis. 
I also have a Stata version, which is compatible and theoretically produces the same results as R. 
I wrote all the codes myself, and I have tidied up the R markdown files. However, there may be still some personal notes in it, which may be irrelevant to the output.
